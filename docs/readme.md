# **NydusNet 🛡️✨**

NydusNet is a secure, multi-device reverse SSH tunnel manager for Windows, built with Python and customtkinter. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to securely expose your local services to the internet and synchronizes your configuration automatically across all your devices.

## **Core Features 🚀**

* **Effortless Tunnel Management**: Create, start, stop, edit, and delete reverse SSH tunnels with a clean, intuitive UI. ↔️  
* **Multi-Device Sync**: Uses a bundled **Syncthing** instance to automatically and securely sync your encrypted configuration data across all your linked devices in real-time. 💻🔄💻  
* **Zero-Config First Start**: On first launch, NydusNet automatically generates the necessary SSH keys. No manual ssh-keygen required! 🔑  
* **Device-Specific Control**: Assign tunnels to be managed by specific devices. A tunnel assigned to your Desktop won't accidentally be started by your Laptop. 📍  
* **Real-Time Status & Logs**: Tunnels now show their live status (**Connecting**, **Running**, **Error**). View detailed SSH logs directly within the app to diagnose connection issues instantly. 🚦📄  
* **Rock-Solid Security**:  
  * All configuration is encrypted at rest with a **master password** using strong PBKDF2 key derivation and AES-256 encryption. 🔒  
  * A **recovery key** system ensures you can regain access if you forget your master password.  
* **System Tray Integration**: NydusNet runs quietly in the background. Manage the app from a convenient system tray icon. 🖱️  
* **Developer Debug Tools**: A built-in debug view allows you to inspect the raw, reconstructed JSON for all configuration objects. 🐞

## **Getting Started: A Quick Guide 🧭**

Follow these steps to set up your first tunnel.

### **Prerequisite: Authorize Your Computer on Your Server**

For NydusNet to connect to your server without a password, you must first tell your server to trust your computer.

1. **Find Your Public Key** 🗝️  
   * Open NydusNet and go to ⚙️ Settings -> Security tab.  
   * The path to your **Public Key** is listed there. Open this file (e.g., id_rsa.pub) with a text editor and copy its entire contents. It will look like ssh-rsa AAAA....  
2. **Log In to Your Server** 🖥️  
   * Use a terminal or an SSH client like PuTTY to connect to your server with a user that has sudo or root privileges.  
   * ssh your_user@your_server_ip  
3. Create a Tunnel User (Recommended) 🧑‍🚀  
   It's best practice to use a separate, non-privileged user for your tunnels.  
   # Create a new user, for example 'tunnel'  
   sudo adduser tunnel

   # Switch to the new user  
   sudo su - tunnel

4. **Add Your Public Key** ✅  
   * As the tunnel user, create the SSH directory and the authorized_keys file.

   # These commands will create the file and directory if they don't exist  
     mkdir -p ~/.ssh  
     nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

   * Paste your public key into this file. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).  
   * **Crucially, set the correct permissions:**

chmod 700 ~/.ssh  
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
Your server is now ready!

### **Step 1: Add the Server to NydusNet**

1. Go to ⚙️ Settings -> Servers tab.  
2. Click ➕ Add New Server.  
3. Fill in the details:  
   * **Server Name**: A friendly name (e.g., "My Web Server").  
   * **IP Address**: The public IP of your server.  
   * **Sudo Username**: The admin user (e.g., root). This is needed for future automation features.  
   * **Tunnel Username**: The non-privileged user you created (e.g., tunnel). **This is the user the tunnels will connect as.**  
   * **Sudo Password**: The password for the admin user.  
4. Click **Save**.

### **Step 2: Create Your First Tunnel**

1. Go back to the main **Dashboard**.  
2. Click ➕ Add New Tunnel.  
3. Fill in the tunnel details:  
   * **Server**: Select the server you just added.  
   * **Managed By**: Choose which of your devices is responsible for starting/stopping this tunnel.  
   * **Hostname**: A friendly name for the local service (e.g., plex, web-app).  
   * **Remote Port**: The public port on your server that will receive traffic (e.g., 80, 443, 8080).  
   * **Local Destination**: The address and port of the service running on your local computer (e.g., localhost:3000, 192.168.1.50:8123). We recommend using localhost:PORT.  
4. Check **"Start tunnel now"** if you want it to connect immediately.  
5. Click **Save**.

### **Step 3: Manage Your Tunnels**

Your new tunnel will now appear on the dashboard!

* **Status Light (●)**: Shows the current state:  
  * ⚪ **Gray**: Stopped  
  * 🟠 **Orange**: Connecting  
  * 🟢 **Green**: Running  
  * 🔴 **Red**: Error  
* **▶️ Start / ⏹️ Stop**: Starts or stops the tunnel. This will be disabled if the tunnel is managed by another device.  
* **✏️ Edit**: Modify the tunnel's configuration.  
* **📄 Logs**: View the detailed, real-time SSH connection log. Invaluable for debugging!  
* **🗑️ Delete**: Permanently remove the tunnel.

## **Roadmap 🗺️: The Road to Fabric!**

Our next major goal is to implement **automated server provisioning** using the **Fabric** library.

This feature was originally planned using Ansible, but that approach was abandoned due to insurmountable packaging issues on Windows. Fabric, being a pure-Python library, is a much more robust and cross-platform solution for our needs.

The Fabric integration will allow you to:

1. **Provision a New Server with One Click** 🖱️💨: From the NydusNet UI, you'll be able to provide root credentials for a fresh VPS.  
2. **Automated Setup**: NydusNet will then automatically:  
   * Connect to the server.  
   * Create a secure, non-privileged tunnel user.  
   * Upload your public SSH key to the tunnel user's authorized_keys file.  
   * Configure the server's SSH service for optimal security and reliability.

This will complete the vision of a fully self-contained, easy-to-use tunneling solution!

## **User Installation 📦**

To run NydusNet, simply download and run the installer. All dependencies are included!

1. **Download the Installer**:  
   * Download the latest NydusNet_Installer.exe from the [Releases page](https://github.com/nater0000/nydusnet/releases).  
2. **Run the Installer**:  
   * Double-click the downloaded .exe file and follow the on-screen instructions.  
3. **First-Time Setup**:  
   * On the first launch, you'll be prompted to **create a master password**. Choose a strong, memorable password! This encrypts all your data 🔒.  
   * The app will then generate a **one-time recovery key**. This key is the *only* way to restore access if you forget your master password. **Save it somewhere safe!** 🔑  
   * Once your password is set, the app will launch, and you're ready to start managing your network!
